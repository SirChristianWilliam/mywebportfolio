        <h1>My Journey</h1>

        <p>
          All my life, I've been fascinated by the unknown. Existential dread
          was a staple of my childhood. When I listen to music, look at art, or
          read a good book, I always think about the creative process that goes
          into it. I listen to specific notes, consider the brush strokes, and{" "}
          <i>feel</i> the poetry of words written on each page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having this perspective, this curiosity, led me down unconventional
          paths. I thought to myself that there's no reason I can't do these
          things, and I wanted to prove it to myself. I've dabbled in a lot of
          different mediums due to this thought process.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of these paths led me to Scratch, a very "high-end" coding program
          for kids. At 13 years old, I became obsessed with creating animations
          and games, all while not really understanding that I was being
          introduced to programming at the time. After hundreds of projects,
          highschool began to take up more of my time, and I put Scratch on the
          back-burner and forgot about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This didn't mean my curiosity lessened, and I never stopped trying to
          bring my ideas to life. I expressed my creativity in a new way,
          creating video with my friends. We dabbled in horror, comedy, and
          other genres. They were extremely embarrassing and the acting was
          awful, so I will never let them see the light of day, but I had a
          great time making them, and the memories that came with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Highschool ended, and I was lost. I couldn't think of a career that I
          would enjoy. I needed something that challenged my mind, and at the
          time, my body. Exercise is a big part of my life so that's why I chose
          Firefighting. 2014-2016 I devoted my time to this field, and then I
          graduated. And I felt even more lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realized that this isn't what I wanted to do after all and realized
          the pressure of going to college was really the only reason I went.
        </p>
        <p>
          I of course needed to get a job in the meantime, so I landed on
          serving. From 2017 to 2022, I spent my time waiting tables, trying to
          save money, and doing a damn good job at it. The problem was, after
          the first year or so, I as doing absolutely nothing to challenge
          myself. That creativity I've always had lay dormant. Over the years it
          got louder and louder and louder, and my mental health took a toll. I
          realized I absolutely couldn't go on like this and needed a change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Covid struck everyone by surprise in 2019. As I was living with my
          grandparents at the time, I decided it was in their best interests
          that I claim unemployment and ride it out. During this time, I was
          able to get back to my creative roots. I had time to read, I had time
          to make music, and I even started a Youtube channel where I would
          splice video clips together and edit them into "funny" parodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          January 1st, 2020, tragedy struck me like a train. My dad was
          diagnosed with ALS, and he passed away, the day after his birthday.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Covid died down and the pressure of returning to my job surfaced, I
          felt a dread like I've never had before. I thought about spending the
          rest of my life working in restaurants and continuing to be that robot
          that did the same routine, day-in day-out. I thought about what my dad
          would think if I made nothing of my life, and didn't pursue my
          passions. I went back to my job waiting tables.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat and thought for many days on what I needed to do to change this
          monotony of my life. I asked myself the same question when I graduated
          highschool, "What job can I exercise my creativity, as well as my
          mind?"
        </p>
        <p>
          One of those options I landed on was programming. The second I had
          this thought, I made the connection that I already have experience
          coding- with Scratch! I felt a little "dull" for not piecing together
          earlier that I had experience in this area, but I didn't let that stop
          me from immediately researching what I needed to do to break into this
          industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to spend a year learning JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I quit
          my job. I then spent every day for 9 months, 6+ hours a day learning
          those fundamentals. I knew this was a long journey and around the 6
          month mark, I began looking for a place I could accelerate my
          learning. I landed on Prime Digital Academy, a school with a high job
          placement rate, and providing real-world, on-the-job experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          August 15th, 2022, I attended the first day of class. From that date
          until January 13th, 2023, my life changed. I could not believe I
          waited this long. Coding for me became a passion. I was, and am, able
          to express myself creatively. As I immersed myself deeper and deeper
          into the world of programming, I began to unlock new possibilites.
          With each project I created, I became more confident in my abilities
          as Software Engineer. As we approached creating our "Solo Projects", I
          instantly thought of how I could relate it to my dad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, Missing Link was born. I was able to honor him by developing an
          application that finds patients with diagnosed medical conditions and
          compare their respective attributes with eachother. I intend to
          develop this project further in the future for the entire world to
          use, as it's potential is unlimited and would help researchers find
          cures for currently "incurable" diseases/conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prime Digital Academy taught me so much and filled in those gaps I was
          missing from my self study. I practiced peer review, group projects,
          got real work experience with real companies, developed Full Stack
          applications, and developed my leadership abilities further than I had
          thought possible. Most importantly, I developed a portfolio showcasing
          my proven skills and experiences and gained the confidence to adapt.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am so thankful I was given the opportunities to reach this point in
          my life, and I'm so excited to see where it takes me. I'm able to
          channel the creative side of myself while also producing meaningful
          products for myself and others. I'm the happiest I've ever been.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a better understanding of who
          I am. Feel free to reach out at any time for any reason!
